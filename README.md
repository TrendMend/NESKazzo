Welcome! This repository is deticated to replicating and working on the Kazzo in Eagle CAD to reference, and work off of.
# How to use this repository
First you have to clone it to your local drive, then add all the libraries in the folder with the same name to your Eagle installation, then tell Eagle to use them by right clicking libraries in your control panel and selecting "Use All". Afterwards, you need to move the NES folder inside projects, into your projects folder, then you need to select "Use All" in the same way you did it for the libraries. Once it changes to active, it will be indicated via a green light.
